/*
 * sync-blog.mjs — pull the built blog corpus into this site.
 *
 * Blog CONTENT lives in the kyo-blog repository, not here. That repo builds the
 * .org sources with the published @kyonax/org2html and emits a manifest, one JSON
 * body per post, per-locale search indexes and the post media. This copies those
 * into the places the site's build reads them from.
 *
 * IT MUST NEVER BLOCK A BUILD. If the blog output is not present — a fresh clone,
 * a contributor with no interest in the blog, the existing deploy path before the
 * dispatch wiring lands — this writes an EMPTY manifest and everything downstream
 * becomes a no-op: no routes, no sitemap entries, no audit targets. The site builds
 * exactly as it did before the blog existed. It says which of the two it did.
 *
 *   BLOG_DIST=/path/to/kyo-blog/dist node scripts/sync-blog.mjs
 *
 * Default source is ../kyo-blog/dist, which is the layout on this machine and the
 * layout the deploy workflow creates when it checks the content repo out.

 * `o2h.js` is org2html's dependency-free progressive-enhancement layer, and it is

 * click-to-play swap. The site deliberately did not load it, so every embed in an
 * article degraded to a plain link — correct, but not a player.
 *
 * NOTHING THIRD-PARTY LOADS UNTIL THE READER CLICKS. The runtime only swaps the
 * facade for the provider's frame on demand, so `nothing the reader pays for`
 * survives: an article whose embed is never clicked costs the reader nothing
 * beyond this one file.
 *
 * MINIFIED ON THE WAY IN, for the reason the book is: the shipped file is 51 KB of
 * hand-authored, heavily commented ES2019 (15.4 KB gzipped) and those comments are
 * the runtime's design record, so they belong in the package rather than on the
 * wire. esbuild takes it to ~21 KB / ~7.5 KB gzipped. It is `public/`, so it never
 * counts against the main-bundle budget and only an article route requests it.

 * `cardImage` by basename against a glob of `src/assets/blog`, so the archive gets
 * an AVIF/WebP with known dimensions. A picture INSIDE an article body is a
 * different problem — org2html does not copy content images and `--asset-base`
 * does not rewrite their URLs, so the body HTML carries the literal deployed path
 * the author typed: `/blog/media/<file>`. Nothing was serving that, so the first
 * article to embed a figure would have shipped a 404.
 *
 * So the media is ALSO copied verbatim into `public/blog/`, where that exact URL
 * resolves. The trade is stated rather than hidden: these body images skip the
 * AVIF/WebP conversion, because optimising them would mean rewriting URLs inside
 * rendered HTML, and a wrong rewrite is worse than an unoptimised PNG.
