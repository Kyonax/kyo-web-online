The core directive of this website is to showcase my professional background, but it's also set up as an index for all the future projects I'm gonna dive into over this century. The interface screams ~cyberpunk/sci-fi~ inspiration, crafted to sync with my vision of what a futuristic UI should be.

* CODE GUIDELINEs
The code adheres to a rigorous structure and set of guidelines to ensure exceptional code consistency. Additionally, the mission is to tailor the code documentation in such a way that it becomes straightforward to recall and modify the code as needed in the future.

This adheres strictly to my personal coding preferences and does not follow any global guidelines; it's tailored solely for my comprehension and also designed to facilitate learning for others.

** NAMING CONVENTIONS
Structured naming convention for files, file structures, and code across JavaScript, HTML, and SASS.

*** Files & Folders
- Use ~kebab-case~ for all files except constants files or configuration files.
- For constants files, the naming should follow the format ~Example.js~.
