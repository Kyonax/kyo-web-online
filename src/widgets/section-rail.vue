/*
 * section-rail.vue — THE CHIP THAT ALWAYS SAYS WHERE YOU ARE.
 *
 * A single line in the corner: `3/6 · PROJECTS`. Press it and the list unfolds
 * from the same box.
 *
 * FULL TITLES WITHOUT OPENING ANYTHING — the reason this design won. One label
 * has the whole width of the chip and never competes for the ~226px gutter that
 * defeats an edge rail on a laptop. It was chosen over a ticks-and-panel rail
 * that had to overlap the article to show a title; that design, the mobile
 * sheet it needed and the switcher that compared them are all deleted.
 *
 * IT IS ONE ELEMENT, NOT TWO. The border lives on the wrapper and the chip is a
 * row inside it, so opening the list grows the same box downward instead of
 * producing a second floating card under the first. A hairline separates the
 * two rows; nothing else does.
 *
 * SQUARE. No rounded corners anywhere — house rule.
 *
 * THE SAME THING ON A PHONE AND ON A DESKTOP. There is no breakpoint in this
 * file: the chip is pointer-independent, so it never needed a touch
 * counterpart.
 *
 * IT OWNS THE BOTTOM-RIGHT CORNER. o2h.js's own back-to-top FAB is fixed in
 * that same spot, so `blog-post.vue` switches it off through `O2H_CONFIG`
 * rather than stacking a second, less capable control on top of this one.
 *
 * THE FILENAME IS LOAD-BEARING. `.size-limit.json` matches
 * `dist/assets/section-rail-*`, and size-limit treats a glob that matches
 * NOTHING as a failure, not as a pass — renaming this file would fail CI with a
 * message that never mentions a budget.
 *
 * CLIENT-ONLY, and that is the whole hydration story. Which section is active
 * depends on scroll position, which does not exist during prerender, so
 * rendering nothing on the server and mounting afterwards is what keeps the
 * label from becoming a mismatch. An explicit empty placeholder, because
 * `UiClientOnly`'s default is a bare `<div>` that would sit in the flow — and
 * this thing's first law is that it never affects layout.

/*
 * THE LABEL BOILS WHILE YOU MOVE AND RESOLVES WHERE YOU LAND.
 *
 * `useScrambleText` is the site's own effect — the hero's — so this borrows it
 * rather than inventing a second one.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF IT: a section change puts the label into NOISE and holds it
 * there for as long as the reader keeps moving. Only once the active section
 * has stood still for `SETTLE_MS` does it decode, at its normal reading pace,
 * into the name of the section actually arrived at.
 *
 * WHY HOLDING IS BETTER THAN THE OBVIOUS TWO ALTERNATIVES. Decoding on every
 * change queues six animations behind a fast scroll, and the label spells out
 * section two long after the reader has stopped at six. Rushing the reveal to
 * keep up just makes it illegible. Staying in noise says "still moving" — which
 * is true — and spends the animation once, on the answer that matters.
 *
 * The boil is `freeze` on a ~30Hz interval, which is the rate the composable
 * refreshes its own noise at, so a held label and a decoding one are visibly
 * the same effect. `stop()` before each decode abandons any job in flight and
 * leaves its FINAL text rather than a frozen frame, so two can never
 * interleave.
 *
 * The visible span is `aria-hidden` and a stable label sits beside it for
 * screen readers, which must never be handed a string of noise.
