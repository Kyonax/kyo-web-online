/**
 * @file main.scss - Central Stylesheet for the Application
 *
 * This file serves as the primary stylesheet for the application, consolidating
 * all global styles, utility classes, and foundational design elements. It imports
 * and organizes essential SCSS partials, including abstracts, base styles, layout
 * configurations, and component-specific styles. The structure ensures consistency,
 * scalability, and maintainability as the application evolves.
 *
 * @description
 * - Abstracts: Variables, mixins, and functions for reusable design patterns.
 * - Base: Reset and base styles for foundational elements (e.g., typography, body).
 * - Layout: Layout utilities and grid configurations for flexible positioning.
 * - Components: Styles for reusable components to maintain modularity.
