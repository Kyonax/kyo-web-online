/**
 * _mixins.scss - Reusable Mixins for Styling
 *
 * @description
 * This file defines reusable mixins for styling throughout the application.
 * It includes a `font-face` mixin to simplify the inclusion of custom fonts
 * by generating the appropriate `@font-face` rules.

 * Import this file wherever mixins are needed, such as in typography or global
 * stylesheets, to take advantage of reusable code and maintain consistency.
