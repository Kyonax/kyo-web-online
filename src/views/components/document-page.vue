/*
 * The shared shell for every secondary DOCUMENT page (/resume, /privacy).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS: the resume page had invented a complete page vocabulary —
 * sheet, breadcrumb, section rules, prose rhythm, sign-off, delegated
 * tooltips — inside its own scoped block, so the privacy pages could only
 * copy it by hand. Two hand-copies of a design system drift; that is the
 * defect class the SEO audit spent a sitting cleaning up. One shell, two
 * consumers, and the second page costs almost nothing.
 *
 * IT ALSO PAYS FOR ITSELF IN BYTES. resume.vue was a STATIC import in App.vue,
 * so its 463 B (gzip) of scoped CSS shipped inside the main bundle and loaded
 * on the landing page, which never renders a word of it — against ~40 B of
 * remaining budget. Both document views are async now, so this whole shell
 * lives in a chunk that only a document page pays for.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS HERE: anything any document page needs — the shell, the
 * breadcrumb, generic block/prose/list typography. What does NOT belong here
 * is page-specific furniture: the CV's contact row, entry heads and tech lines
 * stay in resume.vue, where they are the only consumer.
 *
 * COLOUR LAW (inherited from the resume page): grayscale only. A document
 * reads as a document, so it opts out of the yellow accent, HUD decorations
 * and flare. Typography still comes from the site tokens.

     * `ch` resolves against this element's own type, which is exactly right.
     * It just resolves against the WRONG type here: this shell inherits
     * SpaceMono from `body`, while an article's prose renders in Geomanist
     * inside `.org-root`. SpaceMono's "0" is 9.18px at 15px against
     * Geomanist's 8.30px, so a cap written as 68 characters was delivering
