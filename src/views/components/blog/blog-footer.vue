 * The blog's footer: a brand block and three link columns.
 *
 * IT WAS TWO LINKS — "Blog" and "Home" — which the owner cut as pointless: the
 * nav already carries both, and a footer that repeats the nav is not a footer.
 * This is the column shape the reference uses, sized to what this site
 * actually has to link to rather than to a five-column product menu.
 *
 * IT REUSES THE NAV'S OWN LABELS. Every SITE entry reads the same
 * `kyo-web.landing.nav.*` key the header reads, so the two can never drift and
 * the columns cost the eager i18n catalogue three new words instead of ten.
 * The section anchors are absolute (`/#projects`), not bare fragments — from
 * an article, `#projects` would scroll the article, not open the landing.
 *
 * SiteFooter is landing-only (v-if="isLanding" in App.vue) and carries the
 * full brand signature and a runtime manifest — more than an article needs
 * under it, and its own chunk. This is the deliberate lighter replacement.
 *
 * role="contentinfo" is kept because it is the page's footer landmark; the
 * class is `site-footer` as well as `blog-footer` so hud-nav's INERT_TARGETS
 * still finds it when the mobile drawer opens on a blog route.
 *
 * IT IS THE ONLY FOOTER on a blog route. The archive and the article both used
 * to ALSO pass `signoff` to DocumentPage, so both painted.

      HOW THIS SITE IS BUILT, BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE AND ACROSS THE WHOLE BAND.

      A footer's first job on a site like this is to say what the thing IS. It
      used to be a reading-measure paragraph with a link through to a separate
      /colophon page; the page is gone, so this is now the only place that
      answers the question and it takes the full width to do it.

      THE TOOLS AND NOTHING ELSE — the owner's rule. It was a paragraph that
      went on to MathML, SVG, the licence and the absence of trackers; all true,
      none of it what the line is for. It names the three tools and stops.

      `v-html` because the sentence carries its own inline links; the key is on
      the raw-html allowlist and the copy is ours, not user input.

 * ONE BLOCK, BORDERED ON EVERY SIDE — the owner's call.
 *
 * It was a band: a rule across the top, a second rule under the built-with
 * line, and a vertical rule beside the links that stopped short of both. The
 * top rule spanned the footer's padding box and the inner rule only its content
 * box, so the two horizontals were different widths, and the vertical floated
 * in the middle touching neither.
 *
 * Now the footer is a GUTTER, not a box: it only keeps the block off the screen
 * edge. The block is its two children — the built-with line bordered on all
 * four sides, the columns under it bordered on the other three — so every
 * horizontal is the block's own width, the left and right edges are closed,
 * and the line between the two parts is ONE hairline, the note's, rather than
 * two touching. Cells carry their own padding and the grid has none, which is
 * what lets the column divider run the full height of its row and meet the
 * rules above and below it.

 * Giving each block its own track spreads them over the whole width and the

 *
 * Two columns from `sm` (the two navs side by side under the brand), three

 * `__cols` is gone — it was the only raw media query in this file, and the
 * repo's own `sm` does the same job at a width the rest of the site agrees on.

 * NO GAP, AND NO TOP BORDER. The spacing lives in each cell's padding so the
 * divider can reach both edges of the row; a grid gap would leave it floating.
