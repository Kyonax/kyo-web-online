 * Reactive wrapper over `routeKind()` — "what kind of page am I on?".
 *
 * The answer drives three separate decisions that must never disagree: which
 * view App renders, which JSON-LD graph it emits, and which chrome the nav
 * shows. Each of those used to test `route.path` against its own copy of the
 * resume regex, so adding the privacy routes would have meant a third copy and
 * three chances to forget one.
